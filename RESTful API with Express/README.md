# RESTful API with Express

This project implements a RESTful API using Express, allowing CRUD operations on user data stored in a JSON file.

## Overview

The API provides endpoints for managing user data, including fetching all users, getting a single user by ID, creating a new user, updating a user, and deleting a user.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- Knowledge of RESTful API concepts.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lokeshwar777/loki-nodejs.git
   cd "loki-nodejs/RESTful API with Express"
```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Access the server at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Data Generation

User data in `MOCK_DATA.json` was generated using [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com/) for realistic and diverse sample data.
